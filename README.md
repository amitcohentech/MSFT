# Autonomous Threat Detection & Response System

A comprehensive cybersecurity analytics platform demonstrating Senior Data Engineering skills for Microsoft Defender's Automatic Attack Disruption team.

## Features
- AI-powered anomaly detection and clustering
- End-to-end ML pipeline (data ingestion to prediction)
- Interactive, Apple-inspired dashboard (multi-tab, real-time, time-series, alerts)
- Containerized deployment (Docker/Kubernetes-ready)
- Efficient ETL for large security datasets
- Live demo simulation and raw data exploration
- Single-file deployment script
- Automated testing and system health monitoring

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python
- **Database:** Azure Data Explorer (or similar)
- **ML:** scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow
- **Orchestration:** Airflow or custom
- **Visualization:** Plotly Dash, Streamlit, or custom
- **DevOps:** Docker/Kubernetes

## Quick Start
1. Run `python main.py` to install dependencies, initialize data, launch the ML pipeline, and open the dashboard.
2. Explore the dashboard for live threat detection and clustering.

## Documentation
- System architecture diagrams and presentation scripts included in `/docs`.
- See `/tests` for automated validation and health checks.
